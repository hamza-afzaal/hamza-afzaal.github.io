A Sophophilic Wandering in an Abyss where Pixels meet Algorithms...

I am a computer science scholar, and my area of focus is computer graphics, scientific visualization, machine learning, and haptics. I am keenly interested in rendering, where some of my recent work focused on investigating subsurface scattering techniques. My other interests are volume segmentation and interaction with surface visualizations using force-based haptics.

<!---I am profoundly experienced in C++ and Python programming and along with various libraries and packages that allow me to do rapid prototyping of my research ideas. I have developed a habit of exploring new technologies, languages, and libraries in my spare time, and one of my recent academic adventures is exploring Visualization Toolkit (VTK).-->
