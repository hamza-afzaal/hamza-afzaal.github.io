## &#129440; Cell Wall Segmentation [[github]](https://github.com/hamza-afzaal/cell_wall_seg)

The investigation of morphogenesis in multicellular organisms necessitates precise evaluation of cell wall shapes across multiple specimens. Segmentation employing deep learning has emerged as a dynamic and vibrant research field, employing cutting-edge architectures to generate precise and adaptable segmentations. Within this project, a U-Net architecture is utilized to explore both two-dimensional and three-dimensional segmentation models, while evaluating different loss functions to achieve superior segmentations. For more details, please refer to the github repository.

## &#127982; Shell Tracing: SubSurface Scattering [[github]](https://github.com/hamza-afzaal/shell_tracing_rendering)

Monte Carlo Path Tracing computes the path of the ray in a random fashion but it may take a lot of rays to get decent results, especially in mediums with high albedo coefficient. Shell/Sphere Tracing is an approximation of the path inside the medium, where the steps taken by a ray inside a medium are precomputed based on a probability distribution generated with the given phase function.

## &#128246; Shrinking boundaries: Immersive 3D Bar Chart Interactions Using Force-based Haptics [[github]](https://github.com/hamza-afzaal/bar_sense_haptics)

A study to contrast force-based haptics against visual-only interaction for immersive interactions with 3D bar charts. The pilot study showed users' inclination toward physical interaction with the 3D bar charts for better perception.
